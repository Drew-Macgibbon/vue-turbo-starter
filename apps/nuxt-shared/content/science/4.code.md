## What is it?

Hermes Code is our domain-specific programming language for Hermes.

We chose Common Lisp (a dialect of Lisp) as the foundation for Hermes Code. Because it is an extension to Common Lisp, it retains the powerful features Common Lisp is known for, however, we’ve also added components such as:
- **Formal Specification**; which can be thought of as the blueprint for your software, a document that contains “restrictions” and “checks”, criteria the program should satisfy. And;
- **Formal Verification**; which essentially checks that the functions used in the program are restricted to the subset (group) of functions outlined in the formal specification and that there was no other deviation from what was specified.‍

## Why is it important?

We designed Hermes Code this way so that “Designers” (software architects) could outline the formal specifications in a document and have “Developers” (**programmers**) use it as their blueprint for software creation.

This clarity of instructions combined with the ability to detect faults via formal verification allows Developers (especially inexperienced ones) to make decisions quickly, and move forward with confidence; speeding up the whole development process.

## ‍How does it work?

We’re still in the early stages of developing Hermes Code, for the time being, it’s just a way to speed up our internal development and keep everyone on the same page. Eventually, we want to open the language up to the public.
