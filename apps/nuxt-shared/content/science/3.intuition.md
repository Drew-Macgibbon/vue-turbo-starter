title: Intuition
benefit: Most successful traders often have years of market exposure which helps them acquire a market intuition that cannot be transferred to students. This is why most strategies fail to deliver on the promises of their creators. Agents use Fuzzy Logic to simulate this intuition.

## What is it?

Hermes Intuition is a group of rules that define how an agent will act when its beliefs are triggered.

In our case, agents beliefs are triggered when they find the patterns they were looking for in the Forex markets. A rule might be ‚ÄúIf RSI is above 80 then the market is overbought, this is a sign that we should be looking to sell‚Äù.

## Why is that important?

Our agents need rules about how they act on their beliefs. Without rules there would be no action, our agents would just say, ‚Äúoh hey, I found that thing you wanted me to look for...‚Äù and nothing would happen.

Once we assign them with their ‚Äúintuition‚Äù an agent knows exactly how to respond to patterns in the market that match their beliefs.

Just as successful human traders almost always have a set of rules that make up their trading strategy, rules are also crucial to our agents. Yet, if it was as simple as just following rules, shouldn‚Äôt everyone be rich?

The reality is that successful traders often have lots of market exposure which helps them acquire a market intuition. This intuition is often described as a gut feeling and cannot be explained or passed on from trader to student.

This is why most strategies fail to deliver on the promises of their creators.

Oversimplifying things, we use Fuzzy Logic to introduce a grey area to our rules which means that instead of being black or white they can also be 50 shades of grey, or more if we want üòÇ. This combined with some other wizardry, allows us to simulate human-level intuition.

## How does it work?

We define the number of rules, each rule is a collection of ‚ÄúIF/THEN‚Äù statements. A group of rules associated with a belief is called a membership function. Each membership function belongs to one belief and can have as many rules as we want, although going above 100 is overkill.

So if we were to say this agent has 10 beliefs and 10 rules there would be 100 rules in total (10x10).

These rules are called ‚Äúfuzzy rules‚Äù because they go beyond simple true/false and instead allow for a degree of truth, for instance, an agent can be 70% sure it‚Äôs a great time to buy and 30% sure it‚Äôs a good time to sell (**uncertainty**).

We also take things a step further with the use of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Logic which adds a degree of hesitancy to the outcome, this would make the agent 70% sure it‚Äôs a great time to buy, 25% sure it‚Äôs a good time to sell, and 5% hesitant.

We use this hesitancy and uncertainty to create individual personalities for each agent, a personality is characterized by things such as varying levels of importance to market information or technical indicator correlation, creating individual risk tolerance, assigning bias towards market volatility and so on.
