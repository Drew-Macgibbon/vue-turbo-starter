## What are Agents?

Our system uses what’s called Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to simulate traders trading in the markets. Each agent represents an expert trader that has one or more machine learning optimized strategies for a single market. Just as Oil and Gold should be traded differently, so should the AUD/USD and EUR/JPY.

These agents can work alone or in groups to determine how to best trade current market conditions. When one agent, or a group of them, decide that it’s a good time to trade a signal is created based on what they perceive. A signal consists of metrics related to that agent’s historical performance, a trade direction, and an Entry/SL/TP.

Initially, we intend these signals to be used as trade assistance rather than explicitly actionable advice.‍

## Why do we use Agents?

Multi-agent systems (MAS) enable us to quickly test tens of thousands of trading strategies and iteratively improve them with the goal of creating profitable trading strategies. This process would be a logistical nightmare if attempted manually, so instead, we created a library of building blocks and let machine learning and MAS do their thing.

Once we have a group of agents (called an agent pool), each of these agents can act individually and collectively through consensus or by creating “manager agents” that decide which agent to listen to.

How quickly do you think 1,000 human traders could agree on what to do? 1,000 agents reach consensus in about half a second!

Agents are efficient, their decision making process is auditable, and they can watch the markets 24/5… these are all clear benefits.

## ‍How do they work?

Firstly, this will be a simplified overview that’s not strictly accurate; if you want to know more there are papers over on the research page and you can look through the references at the bottom of this page.
- Each agent has one or more datasets (raw price data, News etc.)
- Each agent has one or more inputs that augment those datasets (RSI, EMA etc.)
- Those inputs all have specific parameter configurations (59 EMA)
- The input(s) are used to find patterns in the market
- Each pattern has 2 or more related rules associated with it
- Rule 1 for pattern 1 and rule 1 for pattern 2 are not related
- A group of unrelated rules forms a fuzzy set
- As related rules become more met an agent is activated more
- When an agent is activated enough it creates a signal
